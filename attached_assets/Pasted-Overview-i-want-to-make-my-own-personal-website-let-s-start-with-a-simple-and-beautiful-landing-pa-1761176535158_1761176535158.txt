Overview: i want to make my own personal website. let's start with a simple and beautiful landing page that just has the text "coming soon...". it should borrow beautiful first principle design methodology from Apple's flowly animations and animiations.dev. it should feature beautiful bouncy animations. i want the website to be named: yaseenmohamed.me



the "coming soon" should have a bouncy feature that on hover over each letter, it bounces up and down and it highlighted. also, an animation should play at the bottom of the screen of a little big hero robot looking guy slowly pans in from the sides of the screen, looks around, and then heads back in the direction he came in.



Spec:



# yaseenmohamed.me — Personal Landing Page



A clean, elegant coming-soon page for Yaseen Mohamed. Designed with Apple's minimalist aesthetic in mind, featuring subtle textures, smooth animations, and playful interactions.
